So, boiz, need some help from Penguin?

Here, keep the change:

General commands:
	$help -> U stoopid
		* Lists all commands
		* I don't think that this information was too helpful, since you already typed $help
			** Did you know that cats can't see directly under their noses? Yes, that's helpful, I know

	$pic *search phrase* -> Damn, how does a Yeti look like?!
		* Gives first image on Google Images using your search phrase

AudioPlayer and YouTube:
	$play *link or search phrase* -> Ahhh, stop emitting sounds!
		* Plays first video that you can get by searching that
			** If you are not sure that it will find your video, use $search
    * You need to be in voice chat
		* ATTENTION! $play will change playlist order, if the video already was there (it will put in on top)
			** If you need to "jump" on other video in playlist, use $playlist jump

	$search *search phrase* -> Did you bloody lose it again?
		* Gives first 4 search results on YouTube (YouTube channels and playlists are included)
			** For every video there will be an ability to quickly play it using $play

	$stop -> Ahh, sweet calm and silence.
		* Stops current playing sound/video, if there are any
```
