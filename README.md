# Penguin Bot

This is a project of a Discord Bot, that will be able to do a lot of different stuff. Like, literally A LOT, because of it's ability to accept custom files to run special programs (It's really easy to code)

## Attention!
If you want to use this bot, you'll have to install "youtube-dl" to your system

* If you are on Linux, you may use **sudo apt-get install youtube-dl** in order to do that
* Windows users will have to go to [the official website](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/download.html) and download it from there (Windows.exe)

youtube-dl allows you to easily grab streams of video or sound of youtube videos, which I'll be using here

You also need to create two files in root folder: **TOKEN.TXT** and **GKEY.TXT**. You need to put your Discord Bot token into **TOKEN.TXT** and your Google Key to **GKEY.TXT** respectively
